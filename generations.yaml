generations:
  - name: "First Generation (986)"
    start_year: 1996
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The original Porsche Boxster (986) debuted as a 1997 model year vehicle after being previewed as a concept in 1993. Developed during a financially challenging period for Porsche, the Boxster shared approximately 40% of its components with the 996-generation 911 to reduce costs. Powered by a water-cooled 2.5-liter flat-six engine initially producing 201 horsepower (later enlarged to 2.7 liters with 217-228 horsepower), the mid-engine roadster offered balanced handling and a more accessible price point than the 911. The Boxster S variant was introduced in 2000 with a 3.2-liter engine producing 250-258 horsepower. The 986 featured a power-operated soft top, a front trunk and a rear trunk straddling the mid-mounted engine, and styling that recalled the iconic 550 Spyder. With its mid-engine layout and near-perfect weight distribution, the Boxster helped reestablish Porsche's financial stability while offering driving dynamics that some enthusiasts considered superior to the higher-priced 911."

  - name: "Second Generation (987)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Boxster (987) refined the original concept with more distinctive styling that less closely resembled the 911. The interior was significantly upgraded with higher quality materials and a more sophisticated design. Initially powered by a revised 2.7-liter flat-six producing 240 horsepower in the base model and a 3.2-liter (later 3.4-liter) engine making 280-310 horsepower in the S variant, performance improved across the board. A limited-slip differential became available, and transmission options included a 5-speed manual (later 6-speed) or Tiptronic automatic, with Porsche's PDK dual-clutch transmission arriving with the 2009 update. The 987 received a significant refresh (sometimes called 987.2) for the 2009 model year, with direct fuel injection engines delivering more power and improved efficiency. The range was expanded with the lightweight, performance-focused Boxster Spyder in 2010, featuring a simplified manual top, reduced sound insulation, and a 320-horsepower engine. The 987 generation built upon the dynamic excellence of its predecessor while addressing initial quality concerns and elevating the model's premium positioning."

  - name: "Third Generation (981)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The third-generation Boxster (981) represented a more comprehensive redesign, featuring a new lightweight body structure with extensive use of aluminum, resulting in improved rigidity and reduced weight despite slightly larger dimensions. The exterior design became more aggressive and sculptural, with larger side air intakes and a more distinctive stance. The base model received a new 2.7-liter flat-six producing 265 horsepower, while the S variant featured a 3.4-liter engine with 315 horsepower. The GTS model, introduced in 2014, extracted 330 horsepower from the 3.4-liter powerplant. The most extreme variant was the Boxster Spyder, featuring a 3.8-liter engine from the 911 Carrera S producing 375 horsepower, a specialized lightweight manual top, and track-focused suspension tuning. The 981's interior quality took another step forward with a design influenced by the Panamera and Carrera GT. This generation was widely praised for its dynamic excellence, with many reviewers considering it among the best-handling cars available at any price. The 981 Boxster represented the pinnacle of the naturally aspirated flat-six Boxster before the transition to turbocharged four-cylinder engines in the succeeding 718 generation."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (982/718)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth and current generation Boxster adopted the 718 nomenclature, paying homage to Porsche's successful four-cylinder racing cars from the 1950s and 1960s. This name change signaled the most significant powertrain shift in the model's history: replacing the naturally aspirated flat-six engines with turbocharged flat-four engines. The base 718 Boxster features a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 300 horsepower, while the S model uses a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four with 350 horsepower. The GTS initially used an uprated version of the 2.5-liter engine with 365 horsepower before reverting to a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six with 394 horsepower in 2020. The limited-production 718 Spyder also features this 4.0-liter naturally aspirated engine. While the switch to four-cylinder engines improved torque, acceleration figures, and fuel efficiency, some enthusiasts criticized the change in engine character and sound. Visually, the 718 Boxster features more angular styling with revised front and rear designs, while the interior received updated technology including Porsche's latest infotainment system. Despite the controversial powertrain change, the 718 Boxster maintains the model's reputation for exceptional handling balance, precise steering, and driver engagement."
